### Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“… May 26, 2023, marks the day I started my journey with Python. As a self-proclaimed noob, I'm eagerly counting the days since then! (Update: I'm still working on that days counter, but maybe I'll get it soon!)

ðŸš€ Motto: Efficacy and Effectiveness.

ðŸŽ“ Education:
- Master's Degree in Molecular and Translational Neurosciences from FMUC: Ongoing.
- Undergraduate in Psychology from FCHS - UAlg: Graduated with an impressive 18/20 (A) in 2021.

ðŸ“š During my studies, I discovered my passion for statistics and data analysis.

ðŸ“ˆ In my master's degree, I faced a tedious task of finding a pattern of 3 different letters in a string of 45 letters. Thankfully, a friend introduced me to programming and ChatGPT.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm honing my skills in Python and SQL, and I'm also enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Course.

ðŸ’¼ My ultimate goal is to become a data analyst and/or scientist in the healthcare.

âš¡ Fun fact: Besides coding, I'm a health enthusiast and a firm believer in the power of data-driven insights to improve well-being.

ðŸŒŸ Interests:  Delving into intricate multivariate analyses, encompassing comprehensive data integration within models, and exploring Bayesian statistics.
